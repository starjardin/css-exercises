        Function we can use value in <code>transform </code>' s value:
        <ul>
          <li>skew</li>
          <li>rotate</li>
          <li>scale</li>
          <li>matrix</li>
          <li>perspective</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>We have to use separate function, in order, and as a  values, e.g <code>transform: scale(0.5) rotate(45deg)</code> when we could have had separate poperties like: <code>transform-scale: 0.5;</code>or <code>transform-rotate: 45deg</code> because the second property will overid the first property so only the property which is declared last will apply</li>

        Often, we want to move the central pin or axis of the transsform away from default position. well, we can use the

        It is preferable to use <code>tranform: translate()</code> rather than <code>posititon</code> and its associated properties because it is much more simpler and easier to read.

        when an element is translated / transformed, the flows of the document stays the same because the element' s ghost is still there. Therefore, the method layout <code>transform</code> is similar to positioning layout.

        The problems that we can run in to when overriding a <code>transform</code> in more specific selector is that we can' t inherit from the child element. It is always good to put your combination selector in the parents in case it will be overrid

        If we want to go 3d, we need to use another property to set wiew over the scene. The property is <code>transform</code>: perspective. <code>tranform-style</code>: presecne-3D.

      <li>
        We can control what transform uses in its calculations in terms of the box model. To adjust this, we use the <code>transform-box</code>

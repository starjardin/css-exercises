                When we use <i>CSS inheritance</i>, It means the children should inherit its value from its parent element. That means the children will have the same value as their parents if we don't specify their value properly. The inherit keyword can be used for any css properties, and any html elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                It affects the curent values to its descendent.
                CSS inheritance refers to the relationship between HTML tags and how certain CSS styles can apply to a tag even though there aren't any CSS rules directly applied to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Here are some exemple of properties have values that are inherited by default: color, font, font-family, font-size, font-style, font-variant, font-weight, letter-spacing, line-height, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, border-spacing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The difference between the <em>curentcolor</em> and <em>inherit</em> when used for color values is the curentcolor keyword is to make properties of an element, inherit the color set by the element's color property.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <em>revert</em>, <em>initial</em>, and <em>unset</em> are used for resetting styles is css.
                The keyword value of inherit tells the browser to search for the closest parent elementâ€™s value and let the current element inherit that value.
                Using <q>revert</q> , you will put back those styles while unset will not.
                <q>unset</q> will simply set the margin to initial,
                The <q>initial</q> keyword represents the specified value that is designated as the property's initial value. Thus, its meaning depends on the property, but not on anything else.
            </li>
            <li>
                Tehre might be some dangers or unintended side-effects when using `inherit` as value if you dont want the children to have the value as its parents. The same as <em>initial</em>, <em>revert</em>, and unset.
            </li>
            <li>
                The universal selector, written <q>*</q>, matches the name of any element types in html document.
            </li>

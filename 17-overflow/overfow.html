      Default value for each property

        overflow: visible

        The reason why we would use default values is we can easely manage to get the value set up.
      </li>
      <li>
        They are usefull because we can see normally the text overflow if we wanted to. If we don' t have enough space it is a good idea to use overflow and that what makes it very powerful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Width and height need to se tbefore those properties work effectively. overflow and white-space.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      The browser's default way to handle contents that are larger than its container is to display the text overflow.
		</li>
		<li>
			An ellipsis is the caractere (...) and an ellipse is those round things 
		</li>
    <li>
      Text-overflow is different from the other properteis because t only occurs when the container' s property has te value hidden scroll, auto, and white-space: non-wrap.

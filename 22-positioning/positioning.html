      Positioning
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The default value for <code>position</code> is <q>static</q>
      </li>
      <li>
        Some of the properties you need to supply when using any non-deault position value are: top, left, bottom, and right.
      </li>
      <li>
        The inferred <code>display</code> value of an element has been positioned is: the value display: block.
      </li>
      <li>
        The thing that is special about fixed and sticky positioning is they always creat a new Stacking context.<br>
        Fixed positioning always keeps the navigation present at all time on the page. Position fixed doesn't move as scroll on the viewport.<br>
        Sitckcy positioning allows us to make elements stick when the scroll reaches a certain point.
      </li>
      <li>
        One of the non-default values for position still maintains a box in the flow document, that is relative
      </li>
      <li>
        Absolute positioned layouts are useful for elements that should not interact. It doesn' t affect any elements in the document.
      </li>
      <li>
        When positioning element <i>absolutely</i>, to lock that element' s coordinates to its parent element is set the properties top, let, right, and bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sometimes if you put two absolutely positioned elements in the same physical space, they' ll stack, that means only one will be visible on top. The rules here are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Controling the stacking order by using Z-index on positioning elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Opacity might by used at some cases.
          </li>
        </ul>
        A certain is element on top because when Z-index propertie is not specifed on any element, elements are stacked in the following order (from bottom to top)
      </li>
      <li>
        Css' s <q>Stacking Content</q> is a three dimensional conceptualization of html along an imaginary Z-axis relative to user. A <q>stacking content</q> is created when an element is positioned and assigned a z-index value other than auto.
